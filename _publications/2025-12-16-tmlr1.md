title: "An analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with Gaussian mixtures"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-12-16
excerpt: 'This paper is about representing the learnt distribution in DRL with a gaussian mixture, providing a first study of the possible probability metrics one can use in that case, and showing the originally used JT2 metric is not ideal. The complete study of the convergence is left for future work.'
