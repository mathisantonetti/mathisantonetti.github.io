Expertise & Applied Innovation
======

As a PhD candidate in robotics specializing in the agile manipulation of objects of all kinds, I am committed to transforming theoretical advances into high-impact technological solutions. I am currently working at [Loria](https://www.loria.fr/en/) on the scalability of imitation methods and their improvement in an industrial setting (for example, for the rapid and inexpensive automation of a supply chain). My expertise covers the entire value chain, from mathematical modeling to implementation on collaborative, concrete, and highly reproducible platforms such as [the so100 from huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so100), with in-depth practical knowledge of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Vision : Performance & Robustness
======
My vision of modern robotics is based on the requirement for operational reliability. In an industrial context, innovation only makes sense if it guarantees safety, repeatability, and efficiency. I develop imitation learning algorithms designed to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable environments of Industry 4.0. My goal is to reduce the barrier between fundamental research and on-site deployment by favoring modular and scalable software architectures.
